## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

This document describes a script designed for analyzing genomic and epigenomic data, focusing on methylation patterns in cancer research.


## Script Overview

The script involves several key steps in bioinformatics data analysis, including:

- **Data Preparation and Filtering**: Using `MultiAssayExperiment` and `ELMER` for handling genomic data.
- **Differential Methylation Analysis**: Identifying methylation differences using `get.diff.meth`.
- **Visualization**: Employing various plotting functions for data analysis insights.

... (continue with other sections)

### Data Preparation and Filtering

```R
library(MultiAssayExperiment)
library(ELMER)

# Filtering genomic features
distal.probes <- get.feature.probe(...)
...

#### Updating Script
To update the script in the Markdown, simply modify the code blocks and add annotations where necessary.

```markdown
### Update Notes

- Adjusted filtering parameters in the data preparation step for more accurate results.
- Enhanced parallel processing setup for faster computation.

... (include the updated code and descriptions)
## Results

(Describe the results obtained from the script...)

## Conclusion

(The final thoughts and conclusions of this analysis...)
